File contains comments. General description of process:

1. Using skills learned from classes and with some aid from w3schools to build the basic structure and styling in HTML and CSS. If not stated otherwise, comments with no mention of w3schools or AI is mostly my own work.

2. Using HTML, CSS and JS code from w3schools, adjusting it to and combining with mine. I have tried to comment comprehensively where this is applicable. 

3. Initially, I have used chatGPT sparingly as I feel I learn best when working and troubleshooting by myself. I have used chatGPT to brainstorm with and to explore what is doable. 

4. When I reached my capacity and knowledge of code, I used AI to fill in the blanks. This is clearly commented in file.
