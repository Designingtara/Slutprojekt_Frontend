<!-- To Do: 1. Displaying the chosen products as a Christmas list with a handwritten-looking font. The background should be placeholder "xmaslist.png" and tell me what size it needs to be and whether the image will repeat.
If code can run efficiently doing the following, then add it: list is animated to look like it is being handwritten line by line. Animation stops after the last item is written out. If this is not recommended, display products the same as in index-html.
Each list item consists of: "title", "price", and the URL for the product (see index.html).

2. Export function: The user can now export a pdf with clickable links to save or share. Create the pdf if possible, but don't build a share function.  -->
